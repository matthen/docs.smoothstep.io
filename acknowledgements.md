# Acknowledgements

{% include smoothstep.html %} was developed by [Matt Henderson](https://twitter.com/matthen2).

{% include smoothstep.html %} is built on the work of a lot of open-source code, and I am grateful to all the projects that have been used in its development.

I would like to highlight [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), as an inspiration for {% include smoothstep.html %}.

Thanks to the following open-source projects in particular:

*   [glslEditor](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslEditor) - from the book of shaders
*   [CCapture](https://github.com/spite/ccapture.js)
*   [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)
*   [FFMPEG.WASM](https://ffmpegwasm.github.io/)
*   [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
*   [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/)
*   [Dracula theme](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/)

The default textures are public domain images, from various sources. Thanks to the artists:
